# ES-LETI-1Sem-2021-Grupo9

This project is based on an API. The purpose of it  is to enable a person to view the amount of time the people working on a project have taken to complete their tasks. 
For that, we will require the use of 2 API's, GitHub's & Trello's. Code of our own writing and proper management for the contents on each task.

About the authors: We are a group of friends that have met by chance during our time at university at ISCTE in Portugal. We have been together for some time and we, plus our client, have decided to come together and create this project. With this, we are looking forward to testing our skill set to the max while also taking into account the client's wishes!
